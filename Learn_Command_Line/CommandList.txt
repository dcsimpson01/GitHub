This document has a quick and helpful list of code for use in a command line.

pwd = print working directory
cd = change directory
ls = list --> it will list all the items in a folder
mv = move --> you use it to move a fiel from one directory to a
mvdir = move a directory
rm = remove a file to delete it
rmdir = remove a directory --> note all files in the directory must be removed 1st
man = manual --> man <command> will print the manual for that command

history --> prints the command history
!<command> will exeucture the last entry of that command
cat = concatenate and will printt he whole file
head --> prints the head of a file
tail --> prints the rows of a file 
cut --> prints select columns 
grep --> prints select rows
paste --> prints the data of two files side by side

nano --> nano followed by a txt file name creates a text file.
> will allow you to save the output of a command as a new file
	for example "tail -n 5 seasonal/winter.csv > last.csv"
	This will save the last 5 rows as a new csv file

Piping --> allows you to not have to create intermediate files in between commands
	Instead pipe an output into another command using |

	Example: head -n 5 seasonal/summmer.csv | tail -n 3
	This will give you rows 3 4 5 from the summer.csv file

	Piping can be used multiple times
Write a pipeline that uses cut, grep, and head in that order to select the first value in column 2 of seasonal/autumn.csv after the header "Tooth".
	cut -d , -f 2 seasonal/autumn.csv | grep -v Tooth | head -n 1

wc = Word Count	--> shows lines words characters
	options -c -w and -l to print only individuals ones

Get rid of the first column from multiple data files at onece:
	cut -d , -f 1 seaonsal/winter.csv seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv

* matchzeor or more characters --> dont have to list every file eg
	cut -d , -f 1 seasonal/*
	cut -d , -f 1 seasonal/*.csv
