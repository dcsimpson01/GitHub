Washington, DC: United States Department of Justice, National Institute of

Abstract: https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=171631
The research also sought to determine the extent to which school-based
management was established in individual schools, as well as its role in
disorder and violence reductions. In addition, the research examined the
extent to which efforts aimed at increasing local autonomy within schools
also changed the attitudes within schools. Findings indicated that high
levels of disorder at middle schools negatively affected academic
achievement and that programs to increase school safety and security are
likely to have positive effects on student achievement. The schools with
the largest student populations were likely to experience many more
difficulties in maintaining order than were smaller schools. In addition,
the basic principles of school-based management were helpful for promoting
the development of school climate, but school-based management is only one
of many strategies for improving school climate and safety. Findings
suggested the need to understand school climate and culture as major
factors shaping the success or failure of any particular school and to
establish mechanisms that provide feedback to those initiating programs of
safety planning and school-based management. Findings also indicated that,
despite resource and program support from central administrative offices,
local decision-makers can and should focus on what goes on in their school
to affect school culture. The research also suggested the importance of
establishing partnerships within and outside the school and the need for an
overarching conceptual and pragmatic framework to guide local
administrators in effective safety planning. Tables, figures, and 114

The project found that youth exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV)
were at-risk for negative consequences, but the size of these effects was
weaker than found in many prior studies and some of the findings were not
consistent with some of the literature related to neighborhood influences.
Policy implications stemming from the current project include the need to
reduce the prevalence of IPV and provide services to children exposed to
IPV to minimize its harmful effects. Although research has indicated that
intimate partner violence (IPV) increases the likelihood of a range of
negative outcomes for children, few studies have examined the short and
long-term consequences of IPV while controlling for other relevant
experiences, investigated the multi-level nature of exposure to IPV among
youth, or explored gender differences in the relationships. This study
sought to aid in this research by examining three questions: 1. What are
the direct effects of IPV exposure on youths’ interpersonal violence,
drug use, and internalizing symptoms? 2. What are the main effects of
neighborhood characteristics on rates of youth violence, drug use, and
internalizing symptoms? 3. Does the effect of IPV exposure vary across
neighborhoods? If so, is the relationship between IPV exposure and youth
violence, drug use, and internalizing symptoms conditioned by neighborhood
characteristics? Data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods (PHDCN) were utilized to answer these questions.
