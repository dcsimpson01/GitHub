Title: Notes for Berry (2008) Piling On: Multilevel Government and the Fiscal Common-Pool
Date: 2018.03.11

Notes:

(1) "A central theme in the recent literature on distributive politics is that na overspending bias emerges when
authority over fiscal policy is shared by multiple officials or jurisdictions serving different constituencies."

Leads to the "overfishing" problem: see
  Benhabib and Radner 1992
  Lavhari and Mirman 1980

(2) "Individual jurisdictions do not internalize the full costs of raising revenue and hence run larger budgets than
would a single general-purpose government that considered the effects of its policies on all groups."

  --> "A key prediction from such models is that the size of government increases with the number of spending authroities"

(3) "Aggregate taxes"
